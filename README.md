Alis (SEGA Master System emulator)
==================================

This is a port to SDL from a very old graduation conclusion project mine.
The original version was written for Visual Studio and DirectX in 2002.

Alis is a SEGA Master System(SMS) emulator with a core engine written in
100% x86 assembly code, only the UI is written in C. All the assembly code
was converted from MASM to NASM format and DirectX to SDL API.

The name "Alis" is a tribute to the main character from my favorite game,
Phantasy Star.
